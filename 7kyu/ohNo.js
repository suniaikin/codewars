/*
Some really funny web dev gave you a sequence of numbers from his API response as an sequence of strings!
You need to cast the whole array to the correct type.
Create the function that takes as a parameter a sequence of numbers represented as strings and outputs a sequence of numbers.
ie:["1", "2", "3"] to [1, 2, 3]
Note that you can receive floats as well.

//âœ…SOLUTIONâœ…
function toNumberArray(stringarray){
    return stringarray.map(Number);
}

const string1 = ["1", "2", "3"]

console.log(toNumberArray(string1));
